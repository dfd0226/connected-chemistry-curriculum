# The Connected Chemistry Curriculum (Java)

This repository houses all code and assets for the Java-based set of simulations corresponding to the Connected Chemistry Curriculum (CCC) (http://www.connchem.org).

Please note that **this particular project is deprecated** as we move toward a Javascript/HTML5 implementation of the same simulations. 

You can find the code for the new version of the Connected Chemistry Curriculum simulations at https://github.com/calixirene/conn-chem. **Please check there for updates and future releases**.
